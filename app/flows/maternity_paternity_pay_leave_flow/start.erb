<% end %>

<% govspeak_for :body do %>
  If you’re having a baby, use this tool to check if you can get:

  * Statutory Maternity Leave or Pay
  * Statutory Paternity Leave or Pay
  * Maternity Allowance

  There are different rules if you’re:
  * [claiming adoption pay and leave](/adoption-pay-leave) for adoptions or surrogacies
  * [calculating the [paternity leave period](/paternity-pay-leave/leave) for births expected after 6 April 2024 (on or after 6 April 2024 for adoptions)

<% end %>

<% govspeak_for :post_body do %>
  You’ll need:

  * your baby’s due date
  * your [employment status](/employment-status), for example 'employee' or 'worker'

  For each current or recent job you have before having a baby, you'll need:

  * the job’s start date
  * how much you earned
  * the job’s end date (if it has ended)

  You might need to give information about more than one job.

  You’ll need the same information about your partner if you’ll care for the child with them.

  ^You might also be able to get [Shared Parental Leave and Pay](/shared-parental-leave-and-pay).
