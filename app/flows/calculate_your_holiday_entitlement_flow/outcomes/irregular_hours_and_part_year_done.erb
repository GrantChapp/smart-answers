  The statutory entitlement for this pay period is <%= "#{calculator.irregular_hours_entitlement} #{'hour'.pluralize(calculator.irregular_hours_entitlement)}."%>

  Employees cannot accrue more than 28 days (5.6 weeks) over the leave year.

  The employer:

  - can include bank and public holidays as part of the statutory entitlement
  - must round up to the nearest hour if the entitlement is 0.5 of an hour or more (for example, 3.6 hours is 4 hours’ entitlement)
  - can include an amount for holiday pay in the hourly rate (‘rolled-up holiday pay’) for irregular hours and part-year workers
  - can provide more paid holiday - this will be in the employment contract and is called ‘contractual leave entitlement’
