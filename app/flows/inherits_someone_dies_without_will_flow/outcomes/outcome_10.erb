  [Find legal advice](/find-legal-advice/find-legal-adviser) to help you figure out the net value of the estate and who will inherit what, as this is legally complex.

  The husband, wife or civil partner is entitled to:

  - all of the estate up to a certain threshold value (this value changes depending on when the deceased died)
  - the personal items and belongings of the deceased
  - a 'life interest' of half of the remaining estate above the threshold value - they only get any interest or income from this part of the estate and cannot do anything else with it, as when they die it'll be passed on to descendants of the deceased

  The children of the deceased are entitled to:

  - a share of the half of the estate above the threshold value
  - a share of the 'life interest' of the husband, wife or civil partner when that person dies - they can do what they like with this share

  If any of the children have died before the deceased, their children (grandchildren of the deceased) will inherit these shares in their place. If any of these grandchildren died before the deceased, their children (great-grandchildren of the deceased) will inherit in their place.

  If any of these people died after the deceased, their shares will become part of their own estate. This includes the descendants’ shares of the 'life interest', even if they died before these shares were given out.

  ^If the deceased died before 1 January 1970, children who were born when their parents were not married cannot inherit if there are other children who were born when their parents were married.
