    - the deceased died on or after 1 January 1996 and their husband, wife or civil partner died more than 28 days later
    - the deceased died before 1 January 1996 and their husband, wife or civil partner died at any time after

    A partner who was not married or in a civil partnership with the deceased has no automatic right to inherit.
