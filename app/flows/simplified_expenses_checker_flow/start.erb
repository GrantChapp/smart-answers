  If you’re a sole trader or partnership there are 2 ways you can calculate business expenses for vehicles, working from home and living on your business premises. 

You can either:

- use [simplified expenses](/simpler-income-tax-simplified-expenses) 
- calculate your expenses by working out the actual costs

  Use this checker to work out which method is best for you.

  ## What you need to know

  You’ll be asked to make estimates about some of your business expenses.

  This tool:

  + does not give exact figures to use in your tax return - it tells you which way of calculating expenses might save you money
  + can only give an answer for one vehicle at a time - if you have several vehicles, start at the beginning for each vehicle

  ## Who cannot use this tool

  Do not use this tool for vehicle expenses if:

  - you use [cash basis](/simpler-income-tax-cash-basis) and you’ve already deducted your vehicle as a capital cost
  - the vehicle you’re claiming for is used by an employee and you [pay tax on it as a benefit](/employer-reporting-expenses-benefits)
  - you’re claiming for a car and you started using it for your business before April 2015

  ^You have to be a sole trader or business partnership with other people - limited companies or business partnerships that have a corporate partner cannot claim simplified expenses.
