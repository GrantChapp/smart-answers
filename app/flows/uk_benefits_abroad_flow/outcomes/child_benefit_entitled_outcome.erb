  You may be able to get Child Benefit for a child or children living with you.

  You may also be able to claim [Guardian's Allowance](/guardians-allowance), if you're looking after  a [child whose parents have died](/child-benefit-child-parent-dies/if-one-or-both-parents-die) and you're getting Child Benefit for them.

  Check the [Child Benefit eligibility page](/child-benefit/eligibility) for more information.
