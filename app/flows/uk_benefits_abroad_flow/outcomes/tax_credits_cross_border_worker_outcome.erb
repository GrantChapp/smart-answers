There’s a different process depending on whether you want to make a new claim or you have an existing claim.

## If you want to get tax credits

You must first [apply for Universal Credit](/universal-credit/how-to-claim). You will not be eligible for Universal Credit because you do not have an address in the UK and you’ll be contacted by a Universal Credit adviser. If you’re eligible for tax credits, your claim will then be passed to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

You do not need a [Frontier Worker permit](/frontier-worker-permit) to make this claim, but it may help your claim be dealt with more quickly.

## If you already get tax credits

If you're already getting either [Working Tax Credit](/working-tax-credit) or [Child Tax Credit](/child-tax-credit) and you want to claim the other type of tax credit, update your existing tax claim by [reporting a change in circumstances to HMRC](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/tax-credits-enquiries).

If you want to check that you’re able to continue getting tax credits while you're abroad, contact the Tax Credits Helpline.
