You cannot make a new claim for tax credits, unless you already get either:

* Working Tax Credit and you want to claim [Child Tax Credit](/child-tax-credit)
* Child Tax Credit and you want to claim [Working Tax Credit](/working-tax-credit)

If you want to claim for either Working Tax Credit or Child Tax Credit, update your existing tax credit claim by [reporting a change in circumstances to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC)](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/tax-credits-enquiries).

If you’re already getting tax credits, you may be able to continue getting them while you’re abroad. Contact the Tax Credits Helpline to check.
