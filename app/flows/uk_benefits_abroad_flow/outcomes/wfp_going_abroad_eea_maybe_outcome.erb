You might get a [Winter Fuel Payment](/winter-fuel-payment) while you’re abroad if you have a genuine link with the UK, for example if you’ve lived and worked in the UK for most of your life.

You must be living in an [EEA country](/eu-eea) or Switzerland during the 3rd week of September immediately before the winter you’re claiming the Winter Fuel Payment for.

Contact the [International Pension Centre](/international-pension-centre) to set up your claim.

 ^You cannot get the payment if you live in Cyprus, France, Gibraltar, Greece, Malta, Portugal or Spain because the average winter temperature in these countries is higher than the warmest region of the UK.
