  ##Category B and BE

  You can tow a trailer that weighs up to 3,500kg MAM (maximum authorised mass).

  ##If you have already passed a category B+E test

  If you took a B+E test, the size of the trailer depends on the BE ‘valid from’ date shown on your licence. If the date is:

  - before 19 January 2013, you can tow any size trailer within the towing limits of the vehicle
  - on or after 19 January 2013, you can tow a trailer within the towing limits of the vehicle with a MAM of up to 3,500kg
