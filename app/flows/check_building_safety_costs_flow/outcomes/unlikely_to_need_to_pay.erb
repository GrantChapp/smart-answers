  Your building is very unlikely to need expensive work to make it safe. This is because thereâ€™s no evidence that the structure of buildings below 5 storeys or 11 metres creates safety risks.

  Check your lease to find out what costs you might have to pay. If you're being asked to pay for major building safety work, contact [under11mbuildings@levellingup.gov.uk](mailto:under11mbuildings@levellingup.gov.uk).

  The Department for Levelling Up, Housing and Communities will investigate any expensive work to buildings under 5 storeys or 11 metres to find out why the building owner is doing this work.
