  Check your lease to find out what costs you might have to pay. You do not have to pay more than the share set out in your lease, even if other leaseholders in the building are protected from paying for building safety work.

  Your landlord (the person or organisation responsible for fixing problems with the building) must prove that they or other landlords in the building (including the freeholder) were not responsible for causing the problems. For example they might be responsible because they built the building. If they cannot prove this they will have to pay to fix the building safety problems themselves.
