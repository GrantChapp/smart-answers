  If the freeholder or landlord (whoever is responsible for fixing problems with the building) wants to charge you to fix other building safety problems, they must show you a certificate proving that both:

  + they were not responsible for causing the problem - for example because they built the building

  + they do not make enough money to pass a ['landlord wealth test'](/)

  They will also need to show there is no other way to pay for the work, for example by claiming on a warranty.

  If they cannot prove this they will have to fix the building safety problems themselves.

  ##You might have to pay up to <%= calculator.presented_remaining_costs %>

  <% if calculator.remaining_costs_more_than_annual_price_cap? %>
    The maximum you'll have to pay to fix other building safety problems is <%= calculator.presented_remaining_costs %>. The freeholder or 'landlord' can only charge you up to <%= calculator.presented_annual_price_cap%> of this total in a year.

    The maximum you'll have to pay to fix other building safety problems is <%= calculator.presented_remaining_costs %>. The freeholder or 'landlord' (whoever is responsible for fixing problems with the building) can charge you this amount in one go.

  If you sell the property, the person who buys it will have to pay what's left of the total.
