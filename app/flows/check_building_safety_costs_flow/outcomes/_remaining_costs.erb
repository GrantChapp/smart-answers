  You do not have to pay to replace cladding on your building.

  If the freeholder or landlord (whoever is responsible for fixing problems with the building) wants to charge you to fix other building safety problems, they must show you a certificate proving that both:

  + they were not responsible for causing the problem - for example because they built the building

  + they do not make enough money to pass a 'landlord contribution test'

  They will also need to show there is no other way to pay for the work, for example by claiming on a warranty.

  If they cannot prove this they will have to fix the building safety problems themselves.

  ##You might have to pay up to <%= calculator.presented_remaining_costs %>

  <% if calculator.remaining_costs_more_than_annual_price_cap? %>
    Your freeholder or landlord may be able to charge you up to <%= calculator.presented_remaining_costs %> to fix other building safety problems. They can only charge you up to <%= calculator.presented_annual_price_cap%> of this total in a year.
  <%else %>
    Your freeholder or landlord may be able to charge you up to <%= calculator.presented_remaining_costs %> to fix other building safety problems. They can charge you this amount in one go.
  <% end%>

  If you sell the property, the person who buys it will have to pay what's left of the total.

  ##Building safety problems the cap applies to

  The <%= calculator.presented_remaining_costs%> cap applies to the cost of fixing any fault from the last 30 years if both of the following apply:

  - it puts people's safety at risk because fire could spread or the building could collapse
  - it was caused by building work, including the building being built
