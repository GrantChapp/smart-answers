<% govspeak_for :body do %>
  In most cases you will not have to contribute to the cost of replacing cladding. If you do have to contribute, [check if you are eligible to apply for the Building Safety Fund](/guidance/remediation-of-non-acm-buildings) for financial help towards fixing your building.
You can also apply to the [First-tier Tribunal for a remediation contribution order](/guidance/making-sure-remediation-work-is-done) to make developers and their associated companies cover the cost of fixing any safety problems in your building.<% end %>
