  Check your lease to find out what costs you might have to pay. You do not have to pay more than your share, even if other leaseholders in the building are protected from paying for fire safety work.

  Before charging you, your freeholder or landlord (whoever is responsible for fixing problems with the building) must prove they were not responsible for causing the problems. For example they might be responsible because they built the building. If they cannot prove this they will have to pay to fix the fire safety problems themselves.

  You do not have to pay costs if your property was built by a [developer who's agreed to pay for fire safety works](/guidance/list-of-developers-who-have-signed-building-safety-repairs-pledge). You'll get a letter if this applies to you.
