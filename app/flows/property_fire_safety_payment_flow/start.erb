  If you're a leaseholder in England, check whether you'll have to pay to replace cladding or to fix other fire safety problems with your property.

  If you have more than one property, answer for one property at a time.

  You'll need to know the value of the property the last time it was sold before 14 February 2022. Check your lease if you're not sure or your leaseholder certificate if you bought your property after this date.

  You do not have to pay costs if your property was built by a [developer who's agreed to pay for fire safety works](/guidance/list-of-developers-who-have-signed-building-safety-repairs-pledge). You'll get a letter if that applies to you.
