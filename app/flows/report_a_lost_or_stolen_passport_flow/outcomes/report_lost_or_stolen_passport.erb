You can cancel your passport immediately by [reporting it online](https://www.loststolenpassport.service.gov.uk/report/passport-holder).

You’ll need to provide a UK mobile number. If you do not have one, you can use an email address and a landline number.

You'll need to [apply for a replacement passport](/renew-adult-passport/overview) if you want one.



%You can’t use the [1-day Premium service](/get-a-passport-urgently) if you’re replacing a lost passport.%
