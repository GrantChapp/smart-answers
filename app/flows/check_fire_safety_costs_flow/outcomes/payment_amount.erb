    You do not have to pay to replace cladding on your building.

    The maximum you'll have to pay to fix other fire safety problems is <%= calculator.presented_leaseholder_costs %>. The freeholder or 'landlord' (whoever is responsible for fixing problems with the building) can only charge you up to <%= calculator.presented_annual_leaseholder_costs %> of this total in a year.

    Any costs you've already paid since 2017 are taken off this total.

    If you sell the property, the person who buys it will have to pay what's left of the total.

    You do not have to pay any costs if your property was built by a [developer who's agreed to pay for fire safety works](/guidance/list-of-developers-who-have-signed-building-safety-repairs-pledge). You'll get a letter from your developer if this applies to you.

    ##Fire safety problems the cap applies to

    The <%= calculator.presented_leaseholder_costs %> cap applies to the cost of fixing:

    - poor workmanship

    ##Responsibilities of the freeholder or landlord

    If they want to charge you to fix fire safety problems, the freeholder or landlord must show you a certificate proving that they:

    + were not responsible for causing the problem

    + do not make enough money to pass a ['landlord wealth test'](/)

    They will also need to show there is no other way to pay for the work, for example by claiming on a warranty.

    If they cannot prove this they will have to fix the fire safety problems themselves.
