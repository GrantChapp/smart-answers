  You may be able to come to the UK without a visa if you’re either:

  * invited as an expert in your profession for a ‘Permitted Paid Engagement’
  * visiting for certain business or academic activities, but not working in the UK
  
  %You may want to apply for a visa if you have a criminal record or you’ve previously been refused entry into the UK.%
  
  ##If you’re invited as an expert in your profession
  
  You can stay in the UK for up to 1 month without a visa, but you can only be paid by a UK-based organisation to do certain things, for example:
  
  * give guest lectures at a higher education institution
  * provide advocacy in legal proceedings
  * take part in arts, entertainment or sporting activities
  
  Check the list of what you can and cannot be paid to do - it’s the same as [what you can do with a Permitted Paid Engagement visa](/permitted-paid-engagement-visa).

  ###What you need at the UK border

  You must provide a valid passport or travel document. Your passport should be valid for the whole of your stay in the UK.

  * you’ve arranged accommodation for your stay
  * you’ll leave at the end of your visit
  * you’re able to support yourself and your dependents during your trip (or have funding from someone else to support you)

  This is the same information as someone applying for a [Permitted Paid Engagement visa](/permitted-paid-engagement-visa/documents-you-must-provide) would need to provide.
