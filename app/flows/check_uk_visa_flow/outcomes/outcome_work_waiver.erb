  What you need to apply for depends on your circumstances.

  ##Business and academic visits

  You can apply for a:

  - [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor) - if you’re coming to the UK for business activities like conferences, meetings, training, academic research or a sabbatical
  - [Permitted Paid Engagement Visitor visa](/permitted-paid-engagement-visa) if you've been invited as an expert in your profession - you can only stay for up to 1 month

  ^ You will not need a visa if you hold a valid [electronic visa waiver (EVW)](/get-electronic-visa-waiver).
