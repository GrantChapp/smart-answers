  You must usually apply for a [family visa](/uk-family-visa).

  ##When you can apply for a free permit instead

  You may be able to apply for a free [family permit](/family-permit/) instead of a visa. Your close family member must both:

  + be a citizen of an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein
  + have been living in the UK before 1 January 2021

  The family permit lets you live, work and study in the UK for up to 6 months (this may be 4 months if you come to the UK after 1 April 2021). You may then be able to apply to the free EU Settlement Scheme to stay longer in the UK.

    ##If you're arriving in the UK before 9 June 2022

    You can join your partner or family member for up to 6 months without a visa if both of the following apply:

    * you booked your journey to the UK before 4pm UK time 11 May 2022 (9am El Salvador time) - for example, if you bought your plane ticket before 4pm 11 May 2022
    * you're arriving in the UK before 9 June 2022

    You can also apply for a free [family permit](/family-permit) if you're eligible - this makes it easier and quicker to enter the UK.

    ###If you need to leave and re-enter the UK

    You'll need a visa to re-enter the UK if either of the following apply:

    * you did not book your return journey to the UK before 4pm UK time 11 May 2022 (9am El Salvador time)
    * you're returning to the UK after 8 June 2022
