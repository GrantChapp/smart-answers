  ##If you're coming to work in an eligible skilled job

  You may be eligible for the [Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa). Various arts and culture jobs are eligible for this visa, including:

  + other creative roles - for example architects, designers or journalists
  + many managerial or administrative roles in arts and culture

  ###Eligibility

  The eligibility criteria include:

  - having a job offer
  - being paid a minimum salary - how much depends on the type of work you do
  - usually proving that you can read, write, speak and understand English

  ^Many arts and culture jobs are on the ‘shortage occupation list’ which means you can be paid a lower salary and pay a lower application fee.

  ###How long you can stay

  Your visa can last for up to 5 years. You can extend it as long as you're still eligible.

  After 5 years, you may be able to apply to settle permanently in the UK.
