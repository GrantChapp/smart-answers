  You must apply for either:

  + a [Standard Visitor visa](/standard-visitor)

  ##Transiting without a visa

  You may be eligible to transit without a visa if:

  - you arrive and depart by air
  - have a confirmed onward flight that leaves on the day you arrive or before midnight on the day after you arrive
  - have the [right documents for your destination](/guidance/immigration-rules/immigration-rules-appendix-visitor-transit-without-visa-scheme) (for example, a visa for that country)

  You must also have an Irish biometric visa (marked ‘BC’ or ‘BC BIVS’ in the ‘Remarks’ section) and an onward flight ticket to the Republic of Ireland.

  E-visas or e-residence permits are not acceptable for transiting through immigration control without a visa.

  All visas and residence permits must be valid.

  You will not be able to transit without a visa if a Border Force officer decides you do not qualify under the immigration rules.
