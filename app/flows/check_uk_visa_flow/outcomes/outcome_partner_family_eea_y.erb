  Whether you need a visa depends on how long you’re staying in the UK.

  ##If you’re staying 6 months or less

  You may be able to apply for a free [family permit](/family-permit) to join your partner or family member for up to 6 months (this may be 4 months if you come to the UK after 1 April 2021).

    ###If you're arriving in the UK before 9 June 2022

    You can join your partner or family member for up to 6 months without a visa if both of the following apply:

    * you booked your journey to the UK before 4pm UK time 11 May 2022 (9am El Salvador time) - for example, if you bought your plane ticket before 4pm 11 May 2022
    * you're arriving in the UK before 9 June 2022

    If you have a free family permit, it will be easier and quicker to enter the UK.

    You'll also need a family permit if you need to leave and re-enter the UK and either of the following apply:

    * you did not book your return journey to the UK before 4pm UK time 11 May 2022 (9am El Salvador time)
    * you're returning to the UK after 8 June 2022

  ##If you’re staying longer than 6 months

  What you can apply for depends on your family member’s situation.

  ###Your partner or family member was living in the UK before 1 January 2021

  You may be able to apply for a free [family permit](/family-permit) instead of applying for a visa.

  The family permit lets you live, work and study in the UK for up to 6 months (this may be 4 months if you come to the UK after 1 April 2021). You may then  be able to apply to the free EU Settlement Scheme to stay longer in the UK.

  ###Your partner or family member are working or studying in the UK

  You may be able to apply as a ‘dependant’ of your partner or family member’s visa. You can work or study if your application is successful.
