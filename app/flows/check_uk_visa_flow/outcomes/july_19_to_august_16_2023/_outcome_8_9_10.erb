##If you’re arriving in the UK before 16 August 2023

You can join your partner or family member for up to 6 months without a visa if both of the following apply:

* you booked and paid for your journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 19 July 2023
* you’re arriving in the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 16 August 2023

###If you need to leave and re-enter the UK

You’ll need a visa to re-enter the UK if either of the following apply:

* you did not book your return journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 19 July 2023
* you’re returning to the UK on or after 3pm (UK time) on 16 August 2023


##If you’re staying longer than 6 months

The visa you apply for depends on your family member’s situation. You can work or study if your application is successful.

###Your family is settled in the UK

You may be able to apply for a [family visa](/uk-family-visa) if your family member or partner:

- is a British citizen
- is settled in the UK (called having ‘indefinite leave to remain’)
- has settled or pre-settled status under the EU Settlement Scheme
- has a Turkish worker or businessperson visa

Your family member must be your partner, child, parent, or a relative who’ll provide long-term care for you.

###Your family is working or studying in the UK

You may be able to apply as a ‘dependant’ of your partner or parent’s visa if they’re working or studying in the UK.

[Browse for your family member’s type of visa](/browse/visas-immigration) to find out how to apply.

###Your family member was living in the UK by 31 December 2020

You may be able to apply to the free EU Settlement Scheme instead of applying for a visa. Your close family member must:

- be a citizen of an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein 
- have been living in the UK by 31 December 2020
- have settled or pre-settled status

To be eligible to apply from outside the UK, you must either:

- be a citizen of an EU country, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein and have a biometric passport or national identity card
- have a biometric residence card (BRC) or biometric residence permit (BRP) issued in the UK which has not expired

Otherwise you’ll need to apply for a free [family permit](/settled-status-eu-citizens-families) to come to the UK. Once you’re in the UK you can apply to the EU Settlement Scheme.

If you have a free [family permit](/family-permit), it will be easier and quicker to enter the UK. You’ll also need a family permit if you need to leave and re-enter the UK and either of the following apply:

* you did not book your return journey to the UK before 3pm (UK time) on 19 July 2023
* you’re returning to the UK on or after 3pm (UK time) on 16 August 2023
