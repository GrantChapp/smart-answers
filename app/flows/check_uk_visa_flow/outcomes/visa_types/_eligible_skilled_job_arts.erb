##If you're coming to work in an eligible skilled job

You may be eligible for the [Skilled Worker visa](https://www.gov.uk/skilled-worker-visa). Various arts and culture jobs are eligible for this visa, including:

+ entertainers or creative artists - for example actors, dancers or musicians
+ other creative roles - for example architects, designers or journalists
+ many managerial or administrative roles in arts and culture

###Eligibility

The eligibility criteria include:

- having a job offer
- being paid a minimum salary - how much depends on the type of work you do
- usually proving that you can read, write, speak and understand English

^Many arts and culture jobs are on the ‘shortage occupation list’ which means you can be paid a lower salary and pay a lower application fee.

###How long you can stay

Your visa can last for up to 5 years. You can extend it as long as you're still eligible.

After 5 years, you may be able to apply to settle permanently in the UK.
