##If you want to start an innovative business

You may be able to apply for either:

+ a [Start-up visa](https://www.gov.uk/start-up-visa), if you’re starting a business for the first time
+ an [Innovator visa](https://www.gov.uk/innovator-visa), if you’re starting a business as an experienced businessperson with at least £50,000 to invest

###Eligibility

The eligibility criteria for both visas includes:

- having a business idea that’s different from anything else on the market
- having your idea assessed by an ‘endorsing body’
- usually proving that you can read, write, speak and understand English

###How long you can stay

You can stay in the UK for:

+ up to 2 years with a Start-up visa - but you can switch to a Innovator visa, if you’re eligible
+ up to 3 years with an Innovator visa - you can extend this as many times as you want

If you get an Innovator visa, you may be able to settle permanently in the UK after 3 years.
