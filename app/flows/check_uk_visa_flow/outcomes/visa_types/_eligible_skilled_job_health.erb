##If you're coming to work in an eligible skilled job

The visa you need usually depends on whether you're coming to work:

+ for the National Health Service (NHS), an NHS supplier or in adult social care - you may be eligible for the [Health and Care Worker visa](/health-care-worker-visa)
+ for any other organisation or type of healthcare - you may be eligible for the [Skilled Worker visa](/skilled-worker-visa)

###Eligibility

The eligibility criteria for both visas includes:

- working in an eligible job, for example a doctor or a nurse
- having a job offer
- being paid a minimum salary - how much depends on the type of work you do
- usually proving that you can read, write, speak and understand English

###How long you can stay

Both visas can last for up to 5 years. You can extend your visa as long as you're still eligible.

After 5 years, you may be able to apply to settle permanently in the UK.
