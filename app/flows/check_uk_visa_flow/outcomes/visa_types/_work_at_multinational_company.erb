##If you work for a multinational company

You may be able to work at your employer’s UK branch with either:

+ a [Senior or Specialist Worker visa (Global Business Mobility)](/senior-specialist-worker-visa)
+ a [Graduate Trainee visa (Global Business Mobility)](/graduate-trainee-visa) - if you’re transferring as part of a graduate training programme

###Eligibility

The eligibility criteria for both visas include:

- working in an eligible job
- being paid a minimum salary - how much depends on the type of work you do

###How long you can stay

You can usually stay in the UK for:

+ up to 5 years with a Senior or Specialist Worker visa - whether you can stay longer depends on your salary and total time in the UK
+ up to 1 year with a Graduate Trainee visa 

You cannot extend a Graduate Trainee visa but you might be able to switch to another type of visa.
