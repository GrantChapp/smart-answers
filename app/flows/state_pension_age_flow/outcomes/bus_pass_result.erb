  The date you qualify for a bus pass is:

  - on <%= format_date(calculator.bus_pass_qualification_date) %>, if you live in England
  - when you turn 60 years old, if you live in [Scotland](https://www.transport.gov.scot/concessionary-travel/60plus-or-disabled/), [Wales](https://gov.wales/apply-bus-pass) or [Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/60senior-smartpass)

  The dates may be different in some areas, check with your council when you can [apply for a bus pass](/apply-for-elderly-person-bus-pass).

  You can get a 60+ Oyster card from [Transport for London](https://tfl.gov.uk/fares/free-and-discounted-travel/60-plus-oyster-photocard) if you live in Greater London.
