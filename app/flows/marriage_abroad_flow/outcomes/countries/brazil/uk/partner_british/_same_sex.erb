Same-sex relationships in Brazil that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as:

- marriage
- ’união estável’, or ’stable union’.

You should check the [travel advice for Brazil](/foreign-travel-advice/brazil).

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to enter into a civil partnership or equivalent in Brazil.

You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local:

* [register office in England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/register-offices)
* [register office in Scotland (PDF, 64KB)](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf)
* [register office in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/district-registrars-northern-ireland)
* [register office in the Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/categories/births-deaths-and-marriages)
* [register office in Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71)
* [register office in Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)

^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You should also check with the local authorities in Brazil to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^

###Legalisation and translation

For your CNI to be valid in Brazil, you'll need to: 

- [get your CNI 'legalised'](/get-document-legalised) (certified as genuine) in the UK
- [get your CNI translated by a sworn translator in Brazil](/government/publications/brazil-list-of-lawyers)

You should also check with the local authorities in Brazil to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

##Make an affirmation or affidavit of marital status in Brazil

If you live in the UK but are currently in Brazil, you can make an affirmation or affidavit of marital status at the nearest embassy or consulate.

* the [fee for administering an oath, declaration or affirmation](/government/publications/brazil-consular-fees) (you normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency)

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK (you’ll need to [get it translated into English](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters))
