Contact the register office (‘cartório de registro civil’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

You’ll need to swear an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) in front of a notary public stating that you’re free to marry.

The notary public will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then give you your notice of marriage. Take this notice to the register office where you’re getting married.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%
