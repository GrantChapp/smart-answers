Contact the register office (‘cartório de registro civil’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll need to swear an oath or affidavit (written statement of facts) in front of a notary public stating that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to [take your Foreigner Identity Card or Tax Payer Registry number to your appointment](/guidance/living-in-brazil#foreigner-identity-card-and-tax-payer-registry-cpf).

The notary public will charge a fee for taking the oath, and then give you your notice of marriage. Take this notice to the register office where you’re getting married.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

###If you do not have a Foreigner Identity Card or Tax Payer Registry number

You can make an affirmation or affidavit of marital status at the nearest British embassy or consulate.

You can:

* [book an appointment at the British Embassy Brasilia](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=105&service=13)  
* [book an appointment at the British Consulate-General Sao Paulo](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=76&service=13)  
* [book an appointment at the British Consulate-General Rio de Janeiro](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=59&service=13)  

When you go to your appointment you need to bring:

* the oath, affirmation or affidavit that you will swear or affirm (the embassy will send this to you after you book your appointment)
* the [fee for administering an oath, declaration or affirmation](/government/publications/brazil-consular-fees) (you normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency)
* your British passport

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need to provide:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)
- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK (you’ll need to [get it translated into English](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters)) 
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
