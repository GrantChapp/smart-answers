Contact the relevant local authorities in Belgium to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You'll be asked to provide a 'certificate of custom and law for marriage' (‘certificate de coutume’ or ‘certificaat van gewoonterecht’) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

You need to apply by post. Your certificate will then be posted to you within 10 working days.

If your partner is British, they also need to get a certificate. You can send both applications in the same envelope. You'll still need to pay 2 application fees, but you'll only be charged once for the postage of your certificates.

s1. Download the application for a certificate of custom and law for marriage.
s2. Fill in and sign the form and payment authorisation slip. You’ll need to get certain documents - these are listed on the form.
s3. Post your application and supporting documents to the British Consulate General Brussels. Write your own address on the envelope too - this is where you’ll be sent your certificate.
