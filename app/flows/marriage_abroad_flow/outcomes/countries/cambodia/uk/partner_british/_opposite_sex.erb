Contact the relevant local authorities in Cambodia (the local district office, ‘Sangkat’, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

%There are certain restrictions on getting married in Cambodia if neither of you is Cambodian. If neither of you is Cambodian, you must check with both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the local Sangkat to find out if if you can get married.%

<%= render partial: 'what_you_need_to_do' %>

If the local authorities say you can get married, you’ll be asked to provide an ‘affirmation for marriage’ document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in Cambodia to swear an affidavit (written statement of facts) that you’re free to marry.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Phnom Penh.](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=135&service=13)

You’ll need to bring your passport, your partner’s passport (or Cambodian ID card) and pay a fee.

### If you've been married or in a civil partnership before

You’ll also need to provide the original document of:

* your decree absolute or final order (this could be a PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
* your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
* your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
* your partner’s death certificate and your marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

If you’ve been widowed and your partner died abroad you can use the death certificate from the country where your partner died. If the death is also registered in the UK you can use the UK death certificate instead. 

###If you do not have the original documents

You can provide copies of your documents if you do not have the originals. 

If your marriage or partnership ended, or your partner died, in the UK you can use:

* [a copy of the divorce, annulment or dissolution document](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
* a copy of your partner's death certificate and your marriage certificate

[Order a copy of a birth, death or marriage certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate).

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner lived in, or were a national of that country, at the time.

The copies of your documents must be signed by a solicitor or notary in the country where your marriage or civil partnership ended or where your partner died. 

Your supporting documents need to be in English or Khmer (the official language of Cambodia). You must provide professional translations if the documents are in another language. You can use any qualified translator or find one on the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) [list of translators and interpreters in Cambodia](/government/publications/cambodia-list-of-translators-and-interpreters/list-of-translators-and-interpreters-in-cambodia).

## What happens next

You’ll need to take the following to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs:

- your affirmation
- a [certified copy of your passport](/certifying-a-document)
- proof of residence, eg a residence certificate - check with the embassy or consulate for advice

You'll also need either:

- your birth certificate - [order a copy of a birth, death or marriage certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate)
- your [naturalisation certificate](/get-replacement-citizenship-certificate)

You’ll be asked to provide a criminal record check – check with the embassy how to do this.


The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue an approval letter which you’ll need to take to the Ministry of Interior. The Ministry of Interior may ask you to complete additional forms and will give you an approval letter.

You’ll need to take the approval letters to your local Sangkat for the marriage registration.
