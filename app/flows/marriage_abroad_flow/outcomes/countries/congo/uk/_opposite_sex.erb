##Before you start

You can get married or register a civil partnership.

Contact the local town hall or civil affairs bureau in the Republic of the Congo to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

You or your partner need to have lived in the Republic of the Congo for at least 3 months before the ceremony.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for the Republic of the Congo](/foreign-travel-advice/congo) before making any plans.

##Prove you’re free to get married or register a civil partnership

You need to prove you’re legally allowed to get married or register a civil partnership by getting a certificate of no impediment (CNI).

^Your partner will also need a CNI if they’re British. If they’re not, the documents they need might be different.

###Get a certificate of no impediment (CNI)

To get a CNI, make an appointment at your [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your marriage.

A CNI costs £35.

^Contact your local register office to find out what you need to do if you live in [Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/district-registrars-northern-ireland), [Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/categories/births-deaths-and-marriages/), [Jersey](https://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).

You’ll need to bring [certain documents](/marriages-civil-partnerships) to your appointment.

Your notice will be publicly displayed in the register office for 28 days. You can collect your CNI after this if nobody registers an objection.

Your CNI will:

- not expire if it was issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland
- expire after 3 months if it was issued in Scotland

Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the [Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/categories/births-deaths-and-marriages/), [Jersey](https://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).

###Get your documents translated

You’ll need to get a certified translation of your CNI into French. Use an [approved translator](/government/publications/list-of-translators-and-interpreters-in-the-republic-of-congo). 

You’ll need to pay a fee for the translation.

##Get married

You’ll need to give your CNI to the person who’s going to marry you. This will be:

- a priest if you’re having a religious ceremony
- a registrar at the town hall if you’re having a civil ceremony

You’ll also need to give them your:

- birth certificate
- passport
- resident permit or visa

###If you’ve changed your name

If your name on any of your documents does not appear exactly as it does on your birth certificate, you’ll also need to give the Congolese marriage authorities evidence of your name change (for example, a marriage certificate or deed poll). 

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in the Republic of the Congo
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You do not need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner is not a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
