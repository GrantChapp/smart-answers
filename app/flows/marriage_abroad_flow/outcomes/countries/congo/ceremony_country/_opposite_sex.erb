##Before you start

You can get married or register a civil partnership.

Contact the local town hall or civil affairs bureau in the Republic of the Congo to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

You or your partner need to have lived in the Republic of the Congo for at least 3 months before the ceremony.

^You should get legal advice before making any plans. Check the travel advice for [the Republic of the Congo](/foreign-travel-advice/congo) and [the Democratic Republic of the Congo](/foreign-travel-advice/democratic-republic-of-the-congo) before making any plans.

##Prove you’re free to get married or register a civil partnership

You need to prove you’re legally allowed to get married or register a civil partnership by getting a certificate of no impediment (CNI).

^Your partner will also need a CNI if they’re British. If they’re not, the documents they need might be different.

To get a CNI, you’ll need to travel to the Democratic Republic of the Congo and give notice of your marriage at the British embassy in Kinshasa.

s1.  Make an appointment at the [British embassy in Kinshasa](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=122&service=10). You need to be in the Democratic Republic of the Congo for 3 full days before your appointment.
s2. Download and complete a [‘notice of marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) and [‘affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form). Do not sign them before your appointment.


###What to bring to your appointment

You need to bring:

- your passport
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy what you need
- the completed notice of marriage and affidavit for marriage

###If you’ve changed your name

If your name on any of your documents does not appear exactly as it does on your birth certificate, you need to bring evidence of your name change to your appointment. For example, a marriage certificate or deed poll.

If you do not, the marriage authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead.

###If you've been married or in a civil partnership before

You need to bring evidence that you are no longer married or in a civil partnership to your appointment.

This might be:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate)

You also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) into French if it’s not in English.

###What happens next

The embassy will display your notice publicly for 21 days.

You’ll then need to swear an oath and pay a fee.

The embassy will then display your notice for 7 days more.

^You do not need to stay in the country while the embassy displays your notice.

If nobody registers an objection, the embassy will issue the CNI for you to collect. You’ll need to pay another fee for this.

You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

###Fees

You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees for the Democratic Republic of the Congo](/government/publications/democratic-republic-of-the-congo-consular-fees).

##Get married

You’ll need to give your CNI to the person who’s going to marry you. This will be:

- a priest if you’re having a religious ceremony
- a registrar at the town hall if you’re having a civil ceremony

You’ll also need to give them a copy of your: 

- birth certificate
- passport
- resident permit or visa

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in the Republic of the Congo
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You do not need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner is not a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
