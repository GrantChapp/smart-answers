##Before you start

Contact the local district office (‘amphur’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

In most provinces you’ll need a certified copy of your passport to get married.

^Check the [travel advice for Thailand](/foreign-travel-advice/thailand) before making any plans.

##What you’ll need to do

To prove you can legally get married in most provinces, you’ll need to:

- apply online for an affirmation of marriage
- book an appointment to swear the affirmation at the British embassy in Bangkok - do this up to 45 days before your marriage
- get your affirmation of marriage translated into Thai, then ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine) by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Thailand
- get a certified copy of your passport

If you and your partner are British, you must apply for and swear an affirmation of marriage separately.

##Apply for an affirmation of marriage

You can only apply for affirmation online and up to 3 months before your planned marriage date.

It costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage)%> per person. The embassy will print it for you on the day of your appointment.

To apply for an affirmation of marriage, you'll need:

- a photo of your UK passport
- your partner’s passport or Thai ID number
- your parents' full name
- name and address of 2 referees who do not live in Thailand
- the province and date of marriage registration at the district office
- a debit or credit card

You'll be told if you need to provide any other documents. For example, if you’ve been married before you’ll need proof that the marriage is over.

[Apply for the affirmation of marriage](https://www.prove-eligibility-foreign-government.service.gov.uk/thailand).

##Swear your affirmation at the British embassy in Bangkok

You must swear your affirmation of marriage at the British embassy in Bangkok.

You'll find out how to book an appointment and what documents to bring when you apply for the affirmation.

##Translate and legalise your affirmation

After your appointment at the embassy, you need to get your affirmation both:

- [translated into Thai](/government/publications/thailand-translators-and-interpreters)
- ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine) by the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Thailand](https://consular.mfa.go.th/th/page/cate-6441-%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B1%E0%B8%9A%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%95%E0%B8%B4%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%93%E0%B9%8C%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%81%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%B2%E0%B8%A3)

## Get married

You should take your affirmation to the district office where you’re getting married. The registrar will marry you and give you 2 identical marriage certificates in Thai.

You can also pay a fee for the registrar to marry you at your chosen wedding venue.

^Religious ceremonies are not valid on their own. The registrar must marry you.^

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Thailand
- it would be allowed under UK law

You do not need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner is not a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
