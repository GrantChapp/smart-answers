##Before you start

Contact the local district office (‘amphur’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

In most provinces you’ll need a certified copy of your passport to get married.

^Check the [travel advice for Thailand](/foreign-travel-advice/thailand) before making any plans.

##What you’ll need to do

To prove you can legally get married in most provinces, you’ll need to:

- apply for an affirmation of marriage
- book an appointment to swear the affirmation of marriage at the British embassy in Bangkok
- get your affirmation of marriage translated into Thai, then ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine) by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Thailand
- get a certified copy of your passport

If you and your partner are both British, you both need to apply for and swear an affirmation of marriage separately.

##Apply for an affirmation of marriage

You need to bring an affirmation of marriage to your appointment at the embassy.

You can apply for an affirmation of marriage online or with a paper form.

###Apply for an affirmation of marriage online

You can only apply online if you have a UK passport. It costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage)%> per person.

To apply for an affirmation of marriage online, you'll need:

- a photo of your UK passport
- your partner’s passport or Thai ID number
- your parents' full name
- name and address of 2 referees who do not live in Thailand
- the province and date of marriage registration at the district office
- a debit or credit card

You'll be told if you need to provide any other documents. For example, if you’ve been married before you’ll need proof that the marriage is over.

###Apply for an affirmation of marriage with a paper form

This costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage) %> per person. You can pay by card, or in the [local currency](/government/publications/thailand-consular-fees) with cash.

[Download application pack](/government/publications/information-for-british-nationals-intending-to-marry-in-thailand) and follow the instructions to fill it in.

Do not sign the affirmation - you’ll need to sign it later at the embassy when you swear your affirmation.

##Book an appointment at the British embassy in Bangkok

You need to book an appointment to swear your affirmation at the British embassy in Bangkok. 

You'll be told how to book the appointment when you apply for the affirmation online or by paper form. You'll also be told what documents you must bring to your appointment, including your affirmation.

##Translate and legalise your affirmation

After your appointment at the embassy, you need to get your affirmation both:

- [translated into Thai](/government/publications/thailand-list-of-lawyers)
- ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine) by the [Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Thailand](http://www.mfa.go.th/main/en/services/16265-Naturalization-Legalization.html)

## Get married

You should take your affirmation to the district office where you’re getting married. The registrar will marry you and give you 2 identical marriage certificates in Thai.

You can also pay a fee for the registrar to marry you at your chosen wedding venue.

^Religious ceremonies are not valid on their own. The registrar must marry you.^

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Thailand
- it would be allowed under UK law

You do not need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner is not a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
