Contact the [Embassy of Ethiopia](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Ethiopia](https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice/ethiopia) before making any plans.^

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in Ethiopia
- it would be [allowed under UK law](https://www.gov.uk/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You won’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](https://www.gov.uk/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
