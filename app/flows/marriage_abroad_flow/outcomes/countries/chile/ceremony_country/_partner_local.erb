Opposite sex and same sex partners can either:

- get married
- register a civil partnership (‘acuerdo de unión civil’)

Contact your local civil registry office in Chile to find out the local rules for getting married and registering civil partnerships, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/guidance/professional-services-if-you-are-abroad) before making any plans.^

## What you need to do

You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI).

To get a CNI, you must post notice of your intended marriage or civil partnership in Chile. You’ll need to do this at the British embassy.

You’ll need to have been living in Chile for at least 3 full days before you can post notice, for example if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Santiago.](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=143&service=10)

At your appointment, you’ll be asked to complete 2 forms.

If you're getting married, you'll have to complete:

- a notice of marriage
- an affidavit or affirmation for marriage

If you're entering into a civil partnership, you'll have to complete:

- a notice of registration of civil partnership
- a declaration for registration of civil partnership

You’ll also need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate
- check with the embassy to find out what you need
- equivalent documents for your partner

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports. If they’re different, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage or civil partnership to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.^

###What happens next

The embassy will charge a fee for taking the oath.

Your notice of marriage or registration of civil partnership will be put on display publicly for a further 7 days.

The embassy will then issue the CNI, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.

You should check if your CNI needs to be legalised (certified as genuine) by the local authorities in Chile.

^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^
