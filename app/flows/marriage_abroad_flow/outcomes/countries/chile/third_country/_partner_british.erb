Opposite sex and same sex partners can either:

- get married
- register a civil partnership (‘acuerdo de unión civil’)

Contact your local civil registry office in Chile to find out the local rules for getting married and registering civil partnerships, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/guidance/professional-services-if-you-are-abroad) and check the [travel advice for Chile](/foreign-travel-advice/chile) before making any plans.^

## What you need to do

You may be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI).

There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/chile/uk/partner_other/opposite_sex)
- [go to Chile and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/chile/ceremony_country/partner_other/opposite_sex)

%If you choose to post notice, you’ll normally have to wait at least 13 days for your CNI. It can take longer depending on the local authorities’ processes and the time of year.%
