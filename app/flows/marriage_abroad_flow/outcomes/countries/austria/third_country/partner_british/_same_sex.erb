It’s possible to have either a civil partnership or a same-sex marriage in Austria.

Same-sex relationships in Austria that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as ‘eingetragene Partnerschaft’, or ‘registered partnership’.

Contact the [Embassy of Austria](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local civil partnership and same-sex marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/austria) for Austria before making any plans.^
