It’s possible to have either a civil partnership or a same-sex marriage in Austria.

Same-sex relationships in Austria that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as ‘eingetragene Partnerschaft’, or ‘registered partnership’.

Contact the [Embassy of Austria](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local civil partnership and same-sex marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice](/foreign-travel-advice/austria) for Austria before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/austria/uk/partner_local/same_sex)
- [go to Austria and post notice at the embassy or consulate there](/marriage-abroad/y/austria/ceremony_country/partner_local/same_sex)

%If you choose to post notice, you’ll normally have to wait at least 13 days for your CNI. It can take longer depending on the local authorities’ processes and the time of year.%

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
