You can get married or enter into a civil partnership in Austria.

Opposite-sex relationships in Austria that are recognised as civil partnerships under British law are known as ‘eingetragene Partnerschaft’, or ‘registered partnership’.

Contact the relevant local authorities in Austria to find out about local civil partnership and marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a marital status document (‘Eidesstattliche Versicherung des Familienstandes’) to prove you’re allowed to marry or enter into a civil partnership.

To get a marital status document, [make an appointment at the British embassy in Vienna](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=38&service=10).

At the appointment, you’ll need to bring original versions of your:

+ passport
+ full birth certificate - this will include the names of your parents
+ proof of residence
+ partner’s passport and proof of residence

^If you or your partner are legally resident in Austria, the proof of residence must be an Austrian residence certificate (‘Meldebestätigung’). If you or your partner are resident somewhere else, ask the embassy what proof of residence you need to bring.

During the appointment, you’ll need to complete the marital status document and take an oath.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage or civil partnership to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example, a marriage certificate or a deed poll).%

If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership, you’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.^

###What happens next

The embassy will charge a fee for providing the marital status document.

You can show the completed document to Austrian authorities to prove you are allowed to marry or enter a civil partnership.

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to become a British citizen once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years after getting married.
