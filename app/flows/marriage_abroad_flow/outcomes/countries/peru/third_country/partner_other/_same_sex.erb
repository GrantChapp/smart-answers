##What documents you’ll need

At the appointment, you and your partner will both need to bring:

- proof of residence, such as an employer’s letter or a bank statement
- your passport

If either of you have been divorced, widowed or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need either:
 
- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) for a deceased husband, wife or civil partner

##What you need to do

At the appointment, you and your partner will need to sign a declaration that you’re legally entitled to marry or enter into a civil partnership.

The embassy will then give you a notice of registration. Once you've paid the registration fee, the notice will be displayed publicly for 14 days.

As long as nobody raises an objection, you can then get married or enter into a civil partnership up to 3 months after you gave notice.
 
You’ll need to bring two witnesses to your ceremony at the embassy. The witnesses will need to bring a photo ID, such as a passport or a driver’s licence.
 
You’ll need to pay a fee to register your marriage or civil partnership and a fee for your marriage or civil partnership certificate.
 
##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK
 
Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
