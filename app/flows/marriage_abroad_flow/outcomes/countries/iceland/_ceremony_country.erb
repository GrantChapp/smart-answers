##Before you start

You must contact the District Commissioner (‘Sýslumaðurinn’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need. Under Icelandic law District Commissioners make their own decisions about the documents needed.

The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passport - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example, a marriage certificate or a deed poll).

^You should get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Iceland](/foreign-travel-advice/iceland) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

###If you're asked to get a ‘certificate of marital status’

You’ll need to fill in a form to confirm you’re not married. You can either:

- go to a [Registers Iceland (‘Þjóðskrá’)](https://www.skra.is/english/about-us/contact-us/) office to fill it in
- email Registers Iceland at <skra@skra.is> and ask for a copy to fill in at home, and then bring it into a Registers Iceland office

Either way, you’ll need to sign the form in front of two witnesses who know you and have an Icelandic national ID number.

When you submit the form at the office, you’ll need to:

- bring an ID document, like a passport
- pay a fee in Icelandic krona - contact a Registers Iceland office to find out what it currently is

You'll then be given a certificate of marital status.

###If you are asked to get a ‘no trace letter’

If you’re from England or Wales, you can get a no trace letter from the General Register Office. 

No trace letters cost £50 for each 10 year period from age 16 or when you entered the UK. 

Specify how many years you need the search to cover and quote reference ‘SEARCH 123’. It can take up to 3 weeks for a no trace letter to be issued.

If you’re from Scotland, you can get a ’to whom it may concern’ letter from the [National Records of Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration/getting-married-abroad/what-documents-will-i-need-to-provide).

If you’re from Northern Ireland, you can get a ‘certificate of legal capacity to marry’ or a ‘marriage index search’ from the [nidirect website](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/articles/marriage-outside-uk).

##Get married

You’ll need to give your certificate of marital status or no trace letter to the District Commissioner’s office.

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Iceland
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You won’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If you need extra copies of your marriage certificate, you can apply for them at [Registers Iceland (‘Þjóðskrá’)](https://www.skra.is/english/about-us/contact-us/).

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
