##Before you start

You must contact the District Commissioner (‘Sýslumaðurinn’) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need. Under Icelandic law District Commissioners make their own decisions about the documents needed.

The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passport - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example, a marriage certificate or a deed poll).

^You should get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Iceland](/foreign-travel-advice/iceland) before making any plans.^
