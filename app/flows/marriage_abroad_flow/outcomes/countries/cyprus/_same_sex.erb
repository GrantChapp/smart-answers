##Before you start

Contact the local authorities in Cyprus to [find out about local civil partnership laws](http://www.moi.gov.cy/moi/crmd/crmd.nsf/All/D6580C099656A06EC2257F53003CA640?OpenDocument), including what documents you’ll need.

Check the local rules with the [British High Commission](/world/organisations/british-high-commission-nicosia).

##Prove you’re free to get a civil partnership

The UK does not issue certificates of no impediment (CNI) for civil partnerships in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI or a similar document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

##After you get a civil partnership

Your civil partnership will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in Cyprus
- it would be allowed under UK law

You do not need to register your civil partnership in the UK.

If your partner is not a British citizen, they can [apply for British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
