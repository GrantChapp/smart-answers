## Before you start

Contact the relevant municipal office in Japan to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^Check the [travel advice for Japan](/foreign-travel-advice/japan) and get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

To prove you can legally get married in local municipal offices, you’ll need to:

- apply for an affirmation or affidavit of marriage
- book an appointment to swear the affirmation or affidavit at the British embassy in Tokyo
- take your documents to the relevant local municipal office

Check with the municipal office how long your affirmation or affidavit will be valid for. Most municipal offices require you to get married within 3 months of the date you swear your affirmation or affidavit.

If you and your partner are both British, you both need to apply for and swear an affirmation or affidavit separately.

##Apply for an affirmation or affidavit of marriage

You can apply for an affirmation or affidavit online. It costs £50 per person.

You can pay either:

- online as you apply
- in cash using the [local currency](/government/publications/fco-consular-services-abroad-exchange-rates) when you go for your embassy appointment

You’ll need:

- a photo of your UK passport
- a photo of your birth certificate with your parents’ full names and your mother’s maiden name
- a photo of your proof of address, which can be a utility bill, a bank statement or a Japanese residence card
- a debit or credit card, if you want to pay online

If it applies to you, you’ll also need: 

- a photo of your certificate of naturalisation or registration
- a photo of evidence if you've changed your name by deed poll
- a photo of a death certificate if you’re widowed
- a photo of your divorce document 

You’ll be told if you need to provide any other documents.

###Help with your affirmation or affidavit application
If you're having problems applying for an affirmation or affidavit online, call the British Embassy Tokyo on +81 (0)3 5211 1100.

##Book an appointment at the British embassy in Tokyo

You need to book an appointment to swear your affirmation or affidavit at the British embassy in Tokyo.

You’ll receive the link to book an appointment when you complete your online application. 

You’ll need to bring the original of all your supporting documents. You don’t need to bring your affirmation or affidavit, embassy staff will print this at your appointment.

##Get married

Take your sworn affirmation or affidavit to the municipal office where you’re getting married. You will need to fill in the ‘Kon-in Todoke’ (a request of registration of marriage) form.

##After you get married

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK. It will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in Japan
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

If your partner isn’t British, they can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
