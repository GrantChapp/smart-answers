## Before you start

Contact the relevant municipal office in Japan to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^Check the [travel advice for Japan](/foreign-travel-advice/japan) and get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

To prove you can legally get married in local municipal offices, you’ll need to:

- apply for an affirmation or affidavit of marriage
- book an appointment to swear the affirmation or affidavit at the British embassy in Tokyo
- take your documents to the relevant local municipal office

Check with the municipal office how long your affirmation or affidavit will be valid for. Most municipal offices require you to get married within 3 months of the date you swear your affirmation or affidavit.

If you and your partner are both British, you both need to apply for and swear an affirmation or affidavit separately.

##Apply for an affirmation or affidavit of marriage

You can apply for an affirmation or affidavit online or with a paper form. It costs £50 per person.

You need to bring the affirmation or affidavit to your appointment at the British embassy. Do not sign the affirmation or affidavit when you get it - you’ll need to sign it at the embassy appointment.

###Apply for an affirmation or affidavit of marriage online

You can pay the £50 per person fee either:

- online as you apply
- in cash using the [local currency](/government/publications/fco-consular-services-abroad-exchange-rates) when you go for your embassy appointment

You’ll need:

- a photo of your UK passport
- a photo of your birth certificate with your parents’ full names and your mother’s maiden name
- a photo of your proof of address, which can be a utility bill, a bank statement or a Japanese residence card
- a debit or credit card, if you want to pay online

You’ll be told if you need to provide any other documents. For example, if you’ve been married before you’ll need proof that the marriage is over.

##Book an appointment at the British embassy in Tokyo

You need to book an appointment to swear your affirmation or affidavit at the British embassy in Tokyo.

You’ll be told how to book the appointment when you apply for the affirmation or affidavit online or by paper form. You’ll also be told what documents you must bring to your appointment, including your affirmation or affidavit.

##Get married

Take your sworn affirmation or affidavit to the municipal office where you’re getting married. You will need to fill in the ‘Kon-in Todoke’ (a request of registration of marriage) form.

##After you get married

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK. It will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in Japan
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

If your partner isn’t British, they can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
