Contact the [Embassy of Mali](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](https://find-a-professional-service-abroad.service.csd.fcdo.gov.uk/find?serviceType=lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Mali](/foreign-travel-advice/mali) before making any plans.^

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in Mali
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You will not need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner is not a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
