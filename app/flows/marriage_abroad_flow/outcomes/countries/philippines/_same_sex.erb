You cannot currently get married or enter into a civil partnership in the Philippines because of coronavirus (COVID-19).

This page will be updated when same-sex marriages and civil partnerships can take place again. Check the [travel advice for the Philippines](/foreign-travel-advice/philippines/coronavirus) for the latest information about COVID-19 restrictions.

## Legal status of same-sex marriages and civil partnerships

Usually when there are no COVID-19 restrictions, same-sex marriages or civil partnerships can take place at the British embassy in Manila.

You would be married or in a civil partnership under UK law, so your marriage or civil partnership would be recognised in the UK. It would not be recognised in the Philippines or other countries where same-sex marriages and civil partnerships are not legal.
