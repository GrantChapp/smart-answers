To get married you’ll need to either:

+ sign an affirmation at a register office in Hungary
+ get a certificate of no impediment (CNI) from a UK register office

##Signing an affirmation in Hungary

You can sign an affirmation at a [Hungarian register office](https://kormanyablak.hu/hu/kormanyablakok) or a [local notary](https://start.mokk.hu/kozjegyzokereso.html?lang=eng&theme=dark#x).  

##Getting a certificate of no impediment

You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Check with the local authorities in Hungary to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.

###Legalisation and translation

Check with a [register office in Hungary](https://kormanyablak.hu/hu/kormanyablakok) if your CNI needs to be:

- ‘[legalised](/get-document-legalised)’ (certified as genuine)
- translated - [find a translator abroad](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers), or in the UK through the [Institute of Linguists](http://www.ciol.org.uk)

You should also check with a register office in Hungary to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

##If your partner is not British

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
