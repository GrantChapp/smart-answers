Contact the local civil registry office where you want to get married in Ecuador to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

You can also form a civil partnership. Check the local rules with the [British embassy](/world/organisations/british-embassy-in-ecuador).

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Ecuador](/foreign-travel-advice/ecuador) before making any plans.

## What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. You can find your:

+ [local office in England and Wales](/register-offices)
+ [local office in Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf)
+ [local office in Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/district-registrars-northern-ireland)
+ [local office in Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/categories/births-deaths-and-marriages)
+ [local registrar in Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71)
+ [local registrar in Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us)

###Check how long your CNI is valid for

The time your CNI is valid depends on where it was issued.

A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You should also check with the local civil registry office in Ecuador to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.

###Get your CNI legalised and translated

Your CNI will need to be:

+ [certified as genuine](/get-document-legalised) (legalised)
+ translated - [find a translator abroad](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters), or in the UK through the [Institute of Linguists](http://www.ciol.org.uk)

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
