Contact the relevant local authorities in Macao to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide an affirmation or affidavit document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

You can book an appointment at the Honorary Consulate in Macao to swear an affirmation or affidavit using the [contact form](https://www.contact-embassy.service.gov.uk/Enquiry/?enquirytext=&country=China&post=British%20Consulate%20General%20Hong%20Kong). You’ll need to:

s1. Go to ‘Do the suggested pages answer your enquiry?’ and select ‘No, I would like to submit my enquiry’ to get the ‘Contact us’ form you need to fill in.
s2. Include ‘MCA’ at the start of the 'What your enquiry is about' field.
s3. In the ‘Details of your enquiry’ field, explain that you would like to book an appointment in Macao to swear an affirmation or affidavit for marriage.

You’ll get a response asking you to pay a fee, and then your details will be passed over to the Honorary Consul in Macao. They will contact you within three working days to agree a date and time for your appointment.

^Your partner will probably need to get an affirmation or affidavit from their own national authorities.^
