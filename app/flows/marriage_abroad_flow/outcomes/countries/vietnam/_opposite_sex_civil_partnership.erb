You need to have been in Vietnam for at least 7 full days before you can give notice. For example, if you arrived on Monday you cannot give notice until the following Tuesday.

###Give notice of your civil partnership

Make an appointment at the embassy or consulate to give notice of your civil partnership and set a date for your ceremony.

You can [make an appointment at the British embassy in Hanoi](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=115&service=13).
