Contact the relevant local authorities in Vietnam to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

You‘ll usually need to provide an [affirmation or affidavit document](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/affirmation-affidavit-of-marital-status-vietnam) as proof that you’re allowed to marry. 

Check what documents you’ll need with the local People’s Committee (known in Vietnam as the UBND) in the region of Vietnam you’re getting married in. 

###If you need an affirmation or affidavit document

You’ll need to:

s1. [Download the affirmation or affidavit document](/government/publications/affirmation-affidavit-of-marital-status-vietnam) and fill it in without signing it.
s2. Make an appointment at the [British embassy in Hanoi](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=115&service=13) or the [Consulate General in Ho Chi Minh City](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=64&service=13).
s3. [Check what documents you’ll need to bring to your appointment](/guidance/notarial-and-documentary-services-guide-for-vietnam).
s4. Attend your appointment and sign your affirmation or affidavit document in front of a consular officer.
s5. [Get your affirmation or affidavit translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) into the local language. 
s6. [Get your affirmation or affidavit ‘legalised’ (certified as genuine)](https://www.gov.uk/get-document-legalised) by the local authorities. 

The embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice on getting your document translated and legalised.

^Your partner will usually need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.

### If you’re divorced, widowed or have changed your name

If you’ve been divorced or widowed, you’ll also need:

- a [decree absolute or final order](https://www.gov.uk/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/)

- evidence of nationality or residence where your divorce took place if it was outside the UK

You’ll need to get the evidence of nationality or residence [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.

You’ll also need to provide evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll.

##What happens next

You must present your documents to a local registrar in Vietnam. They will register the marriage and provide you with a marriage certificate. 

You’ll need to bring your passport. Check with the register what other supporting documents you’ll need. 

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
