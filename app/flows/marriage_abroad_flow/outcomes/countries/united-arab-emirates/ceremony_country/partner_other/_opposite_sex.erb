You can get married through either a:

- religious ceremony in a church or Sharia court - you can only do this if you or your partner are resident in the United Arab Emirates
- civil ceremony at the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department - neither you nor your partner need to be resident in the United Arab Emirates

You can also apply to have a religious or civil ceremony at the [British Embassy in Dubai](/world/organisations/british-embassy-dubai), so long as you can prove that either:

- you or your partner are resident in the United Arab Emirates and there are no suitable churches or Sharia courts available in your local area, if you want a religious ceremony
- you cannot get married at the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department, if you want a civil ceremony

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.

Contact the place you want to get married in to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

##What you need to do if you want a religious ceremony

You’ll be asked to provide an affirmation or affidavit document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in the United Arab Emirates to swear an affirmation or affidavit that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

^If you have dual nationality and you entered the United Arab Emirates on a non-British passport, you must contact the embassy of that country to get your affirmation or affidavit.^

You’ll need to complete an  [‘Affirmation for marriage’ (non-religious) or an ‘Affidavit for marriage’ (religious) form](/government/publications/affidavitaffirmatin-of-marital-status-forms-uae) in English.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the form in advance.

^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^

### What you need to take

You’ll need to take all of the following to your appointment:

- your completed and typed affirmation or affidavit – you’ll be sent the form by email after booking your appointment
- your passport and United Arab Emirates residency or entry visa
- the residency visa or United Arab Emirates entry stamp in your partner’s passport if they’re resident in the United Arab Emirates
- a copy of your partner’s passport or ID if they’re not resident in the United Arab Emirates
- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or a [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) if you’ve been divorced, widowed or you’ve left a civil partnership
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

^A marriage affirmation or affidavit is valid for 3 months.^

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit [translated into Arabic](/government/publications/united-arab-emirates-list-of-translators) and [‘legalised’ (certified as genuine)](/get-document-legalised) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

^A marriage affirmation or affidavit is valid for 3 months.^

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
