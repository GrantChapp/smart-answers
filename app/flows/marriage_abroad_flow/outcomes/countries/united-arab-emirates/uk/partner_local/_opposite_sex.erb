If you or your partner are resident in the United Arab Emirates, you can get married through a religious ceremony at a Sharia court or church.

You cannot get married through a civil ceremony as your partner is a national of the United Arab Emirates.

Contact the place you want to get married in to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for the United Arab Emirates](/foreign-travel-advice/united-arab-emirates) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide an affirmation or affidavit document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in the United Arab Emirates to swear an affirmation or affidavit that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Dubai.](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=112&service=13)

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Abu Dhabi.](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=89&service=13)

^If you have dual nationality and you entered the United Arab Emirates on a non-British passport, you must contact the embassy of that country to get your affirmation or affidavit.^

You’ll need to complete an  [‘Affirmation for marriage’ (non-religious) or an ‘Affidavit for marriage’ (religious) form](/government/publications/affidavitaffirmatin-of-marital-status-forms-uae) in English.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the form in advance.

^Your partner will probably need to get an equivalent document from their national authorities.^

### What you need to take

You’ll need to take all of the following to your appointment:

- your completed and typed affirmation or affidavit – you’ll be sent the form by email after booking your appointment
- your passport and United Arab Emirates residency or entry visa
- the residency visa or United Arab Emirates entry stamp in your partner’s passport if they’re resident in the United Arab Emirates
- a copy of your partner’s passport or ID if they’re not resident in the United Arab Emirates
- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or a [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) if you’ve been divorced, widowed or you’ve left a civil partnership
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit [translated into Arabic](/government/publications/united-arab-emirates-list-of-translators) and [‘legalised’ (certified as genuine)](/get-document-legalised) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

^A marriage affirmation or affidavit is valid for 3 months.

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
