You can get married through either a:

- religious ceremony in a church or Sharia court - you can only do this if you or your partner are resident in the United Arab Emirates
- civil ceremony at the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department - neither you nor your partner need to be resident in the United Arab Emirates

You can also apply to have a religious ceremony at the [British Embassy in Dubai](/world/organisations/british-embassy-dubai), if:

- you or your partner are resident in the United Arab Emirates
- you can prove that there are no suitable Sharia courts or churches available in your local area

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for the United Arab Emirates](/foreign-travel-advice/united-arab-emirates) before making any plans.

Contact the place you want to get married in to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

##What you need to do if you want a religious ceremony

You’ll be asked to provide an affirmation or affidavit document to prove you’re allowed to marry.

Make an appointment at the British embassy or consulate in the United Arab Emirates to swear an affirmation or affidavit that you’re free to marry. You’ll need to bring your passport and pay a fee.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Abu Dhabi.](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=89&service=13)

^If you have dual nationality and you entered the United Arab Emirates on a non-British passport, you must contact the embassy of that country to get your affirmation or affidavit.^

You’ll need to complete an  [‘Affirmation for marriage’ (non-religious) or an ‘Affidavit for marriage’ (religious) form](/government/publications/affidavitaffirmatin-of-marital-status-forms-uae) in English.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the form in advance.

^Your partner will probably need to get an affirmation or affidavit as well. They must book a separate appointment at the British embassy or consulate.

### What you need to take

You’ll need to take all of the following to your appointment:

- your completed and typed affirmation or affidavit – you’ll be sent the form by email after booking your appointment
- your passport and United Arab Emirates residency or entry visa
- the residency visa or United Arab Emirates entry stamp in your partner’s passport if they’re resident in the United Arab Emirates
- a copy of your partner’s passport or ID if they’re not resident in the United Arab Emirates
- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or a [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate) if you’ve been divorced, widowed or you’ve left a civil partnership
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll

###Legalisation and translation

You’ll need to get your affirmation or affidavit [translated into Arabic](/government/publications/united-arab-emirates-list-of-translators) and [‘legalised’ (certified as genuine)](/get-document-legalised) by the local authorities - the embassy or consulate should be able to give you advice.

^A marriage affirmation or affidavit is valid for 3 months.

##What you need to do if you want a civil ceremony

You need to [apply to the Abu Dhabi Judicial Department](https://www.adjd.gov.ae/EN/Pages/nonmuslimsfamilycourt.aspx).

As well as your application, you’ll need to include copies of your and your partner’s:

- passports
- Emirates IDs, if you have these

If you’ve been divorced, widowed or you’ve left a civil partnership, you’ll also need a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) or a [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate). This document will need to be [translated into Arabic](/government/publications/united-arab-emirates-list-of-translators) and [‘legalised’ (certified as genuine)](/get-document-legalised) before you submit it.
