^You should [get legal advice](/guidance/professional-services-if-you-are-abroad) and check the [travel advice for Montserrat](/foreign-travel-advice/montserrat) before making any plans.

##Prove you're free to get married

You need to get a certificate of no impediment (CNI) in the UK to prove you’re legally allowed to get married in Montserrat.

To get a CNI, make an appointment at your [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your marriage. A CNI costs £35.

Your partner will need to follow the same process to get their own CNI.
 
^Contact your local register office to find out what you need to do if you live in [Scotland](https://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/registration), [Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/district-registrars-northern-ireland), [Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/categories/births-deaths-and-marriages), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).^
 
You’ll need to bring [certain documents](/marriages-civil-partnerships/documents-youll-need-to-give-notice) with you to your appointment.
 
Your notice will be publicly displayed in the register office for 28 days. You can collect your CNI after this if nobody registers an objection.
 
If your CNI was issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland, it will usually be valid for 6 months. If it was issued in Scotland, it will expire after 3 months. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the [Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/categories/births-deaths-and-marriages), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).
