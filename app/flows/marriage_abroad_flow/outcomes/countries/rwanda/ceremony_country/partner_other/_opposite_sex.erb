Contact the relevant local authorities in Rwanda to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.^

##If you’re asked to provide an ‘affidavit of marital status’

[Get a UK solicitor to help you write the affidavit](/find-legal-advice/find-legal-adviser). You’ll need to sign it in front of a UK solicitor or notary public.

You then need to get it [legalised by the Rwandan High Commission in London](https://www.rwandainuk.gov.rw/services/service-details/legalisation-of-documents2), and then [countersigned by the Rwandan Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Kigali](https://www.minaffet.gov.rw/services).

##If you’re asked to provide a ‘certificate of no impediment’ (CNI)

The UK does not issue CNIs for marriages in Commonwealth countries. You’ll need to explain this if you’re asked to provide a CNI.

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
