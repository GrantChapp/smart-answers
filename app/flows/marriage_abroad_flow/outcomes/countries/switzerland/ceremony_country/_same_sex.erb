You can get married.

It’s no longer possible to enter into a ’registered partnership’, also known as ’eingetragene Partnerschaft’, ’partenariat enregistré’, ’unione domestica registrata’ or ’partenadi registrà’.

If you entered into a registered partnership before 1 July 2022, you will stay in this partnership. You can choose to convert it into a marriage by contacting a Civil Register Office in Switzerland or the Swiss embassy, consulate or official equivalent where you are.

##What you need to do

Contact the Civil Register Office where you’re getting married to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.
