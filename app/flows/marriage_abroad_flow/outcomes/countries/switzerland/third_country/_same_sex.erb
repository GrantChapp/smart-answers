You can get married.

It’s no longer possible to enter into a ’registered partnership’, also known as ’eingetragene Partnerschaft’, ’partenariat enregistré’, ’unione domestica registrata’ or ’partenadi registrà’.

If you entered into a registered partnership before 1 July 2022, you will stay in this partnership. You can choose to convert it into a marriage by contacting a Civil Register Office in Switzerland or the Swiss embassy, consulate or official equivalent where you are.

##Before you start

s1. Contact the Civil Register Office where you’re getting married to find out about the availability of dates, local laws and what documents you’ll need.
s2. Contact [your closest Swiss embassy](https://www.eda.admin.ch/eda/en/home.html) to start the marriage process.


^You should [get legal advice](/government/publications/switzerland-list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Switzerland](/foreign-travel-advice/switzerland) before making any plans.^

##What you need to do

To prove you're legally allowed to marry, you'll need to either:

- go to the UK and [get a certificate of no impediment (CNI)](/marriage-abroad/y/switzerland/uk/same_sex)
- go to Switzerland and get a civil status declaration from the Civil Register Office where you're getting married

##Naturalisation of your partner

If your partner is not a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.

*[CNI]: certificate of no impediment
