## Before you start

Contact the local civil affairs bureau (‘Min Zheng Ju’) where you or your partner are registered to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

To get married in China, you need to be:

- 22 or older if you’re a man
- 20 or older if you’re a woman

In most provinces, you need to get married in the city or province shown on your partner’s household register (Hukou). Check with the local civil affairs bureau before making any plans.

^Check the [travel advice for China](/foreign-travel-advice/china) and get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.

## What you need to do

To prove you can legally get married in the local civil affairs bureau, you will need to:

- apply for an affirmation or affidavit of marital status (this is official proof that you’re free to get married)
- book an appointment to swear the affirmation or affidavit - this can be at the British Embassy in Beijing or the British Consulate in Guangzhou or Shanghai
- take your documents with you when you get married at the local civil affairs bureau

Check with the civil affairs bureau how long your signed affirmation or affidavit will be valid for. Most bureaux need you to get married within 6 months of the date you swear your affirmation or affidavit.

An affidavit is a religious document. If you do not want to swear a religious oath, you can sign an affirmation instead.
