## Before you start

You can get married at the British Embassy in Beijing. You’ll both need to have been in mainland China for at least the last 21 full days before your wedding ceremony.

^Check the [travel advice for China](/foreign-travel-advice/china) and get [legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

[Contact the embassy in Beijing](/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-beijing#contact-us) to:

- get details of the documents you’ll need to submit
- submit your documents
- set a date for your wedding ceremony
- make an appointment at the Beijing Embassy or the Guangzhou or Shanghai Consulate to give notice of your marriage

## Prove you’re free to get married

When the embassy in Beijing confirms your wedding date, you need to give notice of your marriage.

You need to give notice of your marriage up to 3 months before your wedding day.

You need to have been in China for at least 7 full days before you can give notice. This means if you arrive on Monday, you cannot give notice until the following Tuesday.

You both need to sign a declaration that you’re free to marry.

### Give notice of your marriage

You can give notice of your marriage at the embassy in Beijing or the consulate in Guangzhou or Shanghai. You need to [contact the embassy in Beijing](/government/world/organisations/british-embassy-beijing#contact-us) to make an appointment.

You can pay by Visa or Mastercard or [in the local currency](/government/publications/fco-consular-services-abroad-exchange-rates). You cannot pay with WeChat or Alipay.

You need to bring your and your partner’s passports. Your passport must have an entry stamp showing that you’ve been in China for at least 7 full days.

You’ll need to bring your partner’s ‘single certificate’. They can get this from their own country’s authorities. The certificate needs to be issued within 3 months of the day you give notice.

If you or your partner have been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- your [original decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a printed PDF and covering email from the court) - if you’re divorced
- your annulment certificate - if your marriage or civil partnership was annulled
- your civil partnership dissolution - if your civil partnership was dissolved
- your partner’s [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) and marriage certificate - if you’ve been widowed

Your supporting documents need to be in English or Chinese. You must provide professional translations if the documents are in another language. You can use any qualified translator or find one on the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) [list of translators and interpreters in China](/government/publications/china-list-of-lawyers/list-of-translators-and-interpreters-in-china).

If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time.

The embassy or consulate will display your notice publicly for 14 full days. If nobody registers an objection during this time, you can get married up to 3 months after the date you give notice.

### Sign a declaration

You and your partner need to sign a declaration to say that you’re legally allowed to get married. You’ll do this at the embassy in Beijing on your wedding day.

## Get married

Your wedding ceremony will be at the embassy in Beijing on the date you agreed.

You both need to bring your passports to show that you’ve been in mainland China for at least the last 21 full days.

You’ll need to bring 2 witnesses to your ceremony. Your witnesses must:

- bring photo ID
- be 16 or over
- know you or your partner
- understand English well enough to follow the ceremony and read the marriage register

You, your partner, your 2 witnesses and the marriage officer will sign the marriage register.

## After you get married

You’ll be married under UK law, so your marriage will be recognised in the UK but not in China or other countries where same sex marriage is not legal.

Your partner can [apply for British citizenship](/british-citizenship/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
