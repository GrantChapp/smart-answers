## Before you start

Contact the local civil affairs bureau (‘Min zheng ju’) where you or your partner are registered to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

If you’re a man you must be at least 22 and if you’re a woman you must be at least 20.

## Prove you’re free to get married

You need to swear an affirmation or affidavit that says you’re legally allowed to get married.

This costs <%= format_money calculator.consular_fee(:affidavit_or_affirmation_for_marriage) %>. You can pay:

- in British pounds by Visa or Mastercard
- in the [local currency](/government/publications/china-consular-fees) with cash

An affidavit is a religious document. If you do not want to swear a religious oath, you can sign an affirmation instead.

s1. [Download an affirmation](/government/publications/affirmation-form-china) or [download an affidavit](/government/publications/affidavit-form-china).
s2. Fill it in on your computer - it will not be accepted if it's handwritten.
s3. Make an appointment to swear your affirmation or affidavit at [the embassy in Beijing](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=100&service=13) or the [consulate in Shanghai](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=77&service=13) or the [Guangzhou consulate](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=63&service=13).


You’ll need to bring:

- your passport
- a printed copy of your completed affirmation or affidavit document
- proof of your address, for example a tenancy agreement, utility bill or driving licence
- evidence if you’ve changed your name by deed poll
- your partner’s Chinese ID card and Hukou

If you or your partner have been married or in a civil partnership before, you’ll also need:

- the original [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order) (this could be a PDF and covering email from the court) - if either of you are divorced
- the annulment certificate - if either of you have had a marriage or civil partnership annulled
- the civil partnership dissolution - if either of you have had a civil partnership dissolved
- the [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) and marriage certificate - if either of you are widowed

^If your divorce, civil partnership dissolution or annulment took place outside the UK, you’ll need evidence that you or your ex partner lived in or were a national of that country at the time.^

Your supporting documents need to be in English or Chinese. You must provide professional translations if the documents are in another language. You can use any qualified translator or find one on the Foreign, Commonwealth & Development Office (FCDO) [list of translators and interpreters in China](/government/publications/china-list-of-lawyers/list-of-translators-and-interpreters-in-china).

## Get married

You’ll need to give your signed affirmation or affidavit to the registrar at the civil affairs bureau where you or your partner are registered.

The registrar will marry you and give you a marriage certificate.

## After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in China
- it would be allowed under UK law

You do not need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner is not a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
