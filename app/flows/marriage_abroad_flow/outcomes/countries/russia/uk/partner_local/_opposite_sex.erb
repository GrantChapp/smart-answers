Contact the [Embassy of Russia](/government/publications/foreign-embassies-in-the-uk) before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Russia](/foreign-travel-advice/russia) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

You can normally get a CNI by giving a notice of marriage at your local register office or registrar in the UK. Find your local office or registrar in [England and Wales](https://www.gov.uk/register-offices), [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](https://www.nidirect.gov.uk/contacts/district-registrars-northern-ireland), [Isle of Man](https://www.gov.im/categories/births-deaths-and-marriages), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).

^A CNI issued in Scotland is valid for 3 months. A CNI issued in England, Wales or Northern Ireland will not expire. Check with your local register office to find out how long a CNI is valid if you live in the Channel Islands or the Isle of Man. You should also check with the local authorities in Russia to find out how long a CNI is valid under local law.^

###Legalisation and translation

To get married in Russia with a UK-issued CNI, you need to either:

- [get your CNI legalised](/get-document-legalised) (certified as genuine) and translated - [find a translator abroad](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers), or in the UK through the [Institute of Linguists](http://www.ciol.org.uk)
- exchange your CNI for one that’s valid in Russia - you must [make an appointment at the British embassy to exchange your CNI](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=132&service=4)

You should also check with the Russian marriage registrar to find out if you need to provide legalised and translated copies of any other documents.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example, a marriage certificate or a deed poll). The Russian spelling of your name needs to be the same on all your Russian language documents - if not, the authorities may not accept your documents.%

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
