## What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

## Using your CNI

## Other documents you may need

Check with the Russian marriage registrar to find out if you need legalised and translated copies of any other documents. 

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example, a marriage certificate or a deed poll). The Russian spelling of your name needs to be the same on all your Russian language documents - if not, the authorities may not accept your documents.%

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
