  You can get a [Winter Fuel Payment](/winter-fuel-payment) while you’re in Ireland if you have a genuine link with the UK, for example if you’ve lived and worked in the UK for most of your life.

  You must be living in Ireland during the 3rd week of September immediately before the winter you’re claiming the Winter Fuel Payment for.

  Contact the [International Pension Centre](/international-pension-centre) to set up your claim.
