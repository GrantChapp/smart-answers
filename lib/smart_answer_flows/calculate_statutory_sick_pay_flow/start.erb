  Statutory Sick Pay (SSP) calculator -  calculate SSP for an employee
<% end %>

<% govspeak_for :body do %>
  You’re only responsible for paying SSP if:

  - you pay Class 1 National Insurance contributions for your employee (or would do if not for their age or their level of earnings)
  - your employee was sick for 4 or more days in a row (including non-working days)
  - your employee has told you they’re sick within your own time limit (or 7 days if you do not have one)

  ^ You cannot use the calculator for periods of sickness before 6 April 2011.^

  *[SSP]: Statutory Sick Pay

  ##Sick leave because of coronavirus (COVID-19)
  
  Do not use the calculator if your employee is self-isolating because either:

  - you’ve been [notified by the NHS or a public health authority](/guidance/nhs-test-and-trace-how-it-works) that you’ve been in contact with someone with coronavirus
  - someone in your '[support bubble](/guidance/meeting-people-from-outside-your-household-from-4-july)' (or your 'extended household' if you live in [Scotland](https://www.gov.scot/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-protection-levels) or [Wales](https://gov.wales/visiting-people-private-homes-alert-level-3#section-58445) has symptoms or has tested positive for coronavirus 

  You'll need to [work out the SSP manually](/guidance/statutory-sick-pay-manually-calculate-your-employees-payments).

  ##Different periods of sick leave

  You can combine periods of sick leave if the gap between them is 8 weeks or less. These are called ‘linked Periods of Incapacity for Work (PIW)’.

  If there’s more than one linked PIW, you’ll need to [work out the SSP manually](/guidance/statutory-sick-pay-manually-calculate-your-employees-payments#link-period-of-incapacity-for-work).
