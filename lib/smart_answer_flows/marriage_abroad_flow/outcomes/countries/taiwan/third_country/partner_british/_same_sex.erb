##Before you start

Contact the [Household Registration Office](https://www.ris.gov.tw/app/portal/20) for the place you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you and your partner will need.

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Taiwan](/foreign-travel-advice/taiwan) before making any plans.

##If you need to get a certificate of no impediment (CNI)

The local Household Registration Office may tell you that you need a CNI in order to get married.

To get a CNI, you must travel to the UK and make an appointment at a [local register office](/register-offices) to give notice of your marriage. A CNI costs £35.

^Contact a local register office to find out what you need to do if you’re in [Scotland](http://www.nrscotland.gov.uk/files/registration/reglist.pdf), [Northern Ireland](http://www.nidirect.gov.uk/index/information-and-services/government-citizens-and-rights/births-and-registration/district-registrars-in-northern-ireland.htm), [Isle of Man](http://www.gov.im/registries/general/civilregistry), [Jersey](http://www.gov.je/pages/contacts.aspx?contactId=71) or [Guernsey](http://www.guernseyroyalcourt.gg/article/1663/Contact-Us).^

###Get your documents legalised, authorised and translated

You’ll need to [get your CNI legalised](/get-document-legalised) (certified as genuine) by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office.

You’ll then need to get it [authorised by the Taipei Representative Office in London](https://www.taiwanembassy.org/uk_en/post/3988.html) or [authorised by the Taipei Representative Office in Edinburgh](https://www.roc-taiwan.org/ukedi_en/post/720.html), depending on where you got your CNI from.

You’ll also need to get a certified translation of your CNI. You need to use an [approved translator](/government/publications/taiwan-list-of-translators-and-interpreters/list-of-translators-and-interpreters-in-taiwan).

You’ll be charged fees for translating your documents.

###If you’ve changed your name

If your name on any of your documents doesn’t appear exactly as it does on your birth certificate, you’ll need to give the local Household Registration Office evidence of your name change (for example, a marriage certificate or deed poll). If you don’t, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead.

##Get married

After you have all the documents that the local Household Registration Office has told you to collect, take them to the office.

They can then marry you and give you a marriage certificate.

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in Taiwan
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK.
