Contact the local civil registry office where you want to get married in Ecuador to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

You can also form a civil partnership. Check the local rules with the [British embassy](/world/organisations/british-embassy-in-ecuador).

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Ecuador](/foreign-travel-advice/ecuador) before making any plans.

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

There are 2 ways you can get a CNI:

- [go to the UK and post notice with a UK registrar](/marriage-abroad/y/ecuador/uk/partner_other/opposite_sex)
- [go to Ecuador and post notice at the British embassy](/marriage-abroad/y/ecuador/ceremony_country/partner_other/opposite_sex)

##Naturalisation of your partner if they move to the UK

Your partner can apply to [become a British citizen](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
