##Before you start

You can get married or register a civil partnership.

Contact the local town hall or civil affairs bureau in the Republic of the Congo to find out about local laws, including what documents you’ll need.

You or your partner need to have lived in the Republic of the Congo for at least 3 months before the ceremony.

##Prove you’re free to get married or register a civil partnership

You need to prove you’re legally allowed to get married or register a civil partnership by getting a certificate of no impediment (CNI).

^Your partner will also need a CNI if they’re British. If they’re not, the documents they need might be different.

###Get a CNI

To get a CNI, you can either go to:

- [the UK](/marriage-abroad/y/congo/uk/opposite_sex) and give notice of your marriage with a UK registrar
- [the Republic of the Congo](/marriage-abroad/y/congo/ceremony_country/opposite_sex) and then give notice of your marriage at the embassy in the Democratic Republic of the Congo

##Get married

You’ll need to give your CNI to the person who’s going to marry you. This will be:

- a priest if you’re having a religious ceremony
- a registrar at the town hall if you’re having a civil ceremony

You’ll also need to give them a copy of your: 

- birth certificate
- passport
- resident permit or visa

###If you’ve changed your name

If your name on any of your documents does not appear exactly as it does on your birth certificate, you’ll need to give the priest or registrar evidence of your name change.

For example, a marriage certificate or deed poll.

If you do not, they may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead.

##After you get married

Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you followed the correct process according to the law in the Republic of the Congo
- it would be [allowed under UK law](/marriages-civil-partnerships)

You do not need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner is not a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
