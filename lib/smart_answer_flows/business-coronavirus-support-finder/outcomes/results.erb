    ### Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme (furlough scheme)

    If you've had to ask your employees to stop working or work less because of coronavirus (put them on 'furlough') you can get support to pay their wages for the hours they do not work. The scheme has been extended until the end of September 2021.

    The government will pay:

    - 80% of employees’ usual wages for hours they do not work, up to a maximum of £2,500 per month, until the end of June
    - 70% of employees' usual wages for hours they do not work, up to a maximum of £2187.50 per month, until the end of July
    - 60% of employees' usual wages for hours they do not work, up to a maximum of £1875 per month, until the end of August and September

    The employees must receive 80% of their usual wages up to a maximum of £2500 per month until the end of September 2021.
    From July 2021 to September 2021, you will have to make up the difference between the government payment and what the employee should receive.


    You must submit your claims by 11.59pm 14 calendar days after the month you’re claiming for. If this time falls on the weekend or a bank holiday then claims should be submitted on the next working day.
    For example you must submit your claim by:

    - 14 April 2021, for eligible employees on furlough in March 2021
    - 14 May 2021, for eligible employees on furlough in April 2021

  If you deferred VAT payments due between 20 March 2020 and 30 June 2020 and still have payments to make, you can:

  - pay the deferred VAT in full, on or before 31 March 2021
  - use the online VAT deferral new payment scheme to spread your payment if you cannot afford to pay by 31 March 2021

  The new scheme lets you pay your deferred VAT in equal instalments, interest free. You can spread your payments across 2 to 11 monthly instalments, including your first payment, depending on when you join. The earlier you join, the more months you have to spread your payments across.

  If you join by:

  - 19 March 2021, you can pay in 11 instalments
  - 21 April 2021, you can pay in 10 instalments
  - 19 May 2021, you can pay in 9 instalments
  - 21 June 2021, you can pay in 8 instalments

  You must opt into the VAT deferral new payment scheme by 21 June 2021.

  If you’re on the VAT Annual Accounting Scheme or the VAT Payment on Account Scheme, you can join the scheme from 10 March 2021.

  If you've a Time to Pay arrangement already in place for your deferred VAT, you cannot use the online scheme. If you need to amend your Time To Pay arrangement, contact HMRC to do this.

    ### Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS)

     The fourth grant is calculated at 80% of 3 months’ average trading profits. It will be paid out in a single instalment and capped at £7,500 in total. How much you receive will depend on your average trading profits.

     To be eligible for the fourth grant you must be a self-employed individual or a member of a partnership. You cannot claim the grant if you trade through a limited company or a trust.

    You must have traded in tax years:

    - 2019 to 2020
    - 2020 to 2021
    - submitted your tax return on or before 2 March 2021

    HMRC has contacted:

    - the majority of customers who may be eligible for the fourth SEISS grant, and provided a personal claim date, which is the first date you can claim from
    - customers that have claimed SEISS in the past, but who are ineligible for the fourth SEISS grant

    The online claim service for the fourth SEISS grant is now open, but you can only claim from your personal claim date. You'll be able to access the service through the link below.

    The online claim service can also tell you when you’re able to make your claim, if you:

    - meet all the criteria
    - confirm to HMRC that your business has been significantly impacted by Covid-19

    From 30 April, the online claims service will allow any remaining eligible customers to claim. The online claim service for the SEISS fourth grant will close on 1 June.

    You must make the claim yourself. You must not ask a tax agent or adviser to claim on your behalf as this will trigger an alert, which will delay your payment.
