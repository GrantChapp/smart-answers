##What you need to do

You might need to complete a statutory declaration or affirmation of marital status at the registry office (‘anyakönyvi hivatal’) where you’re getting married, unless you have these documents from the UK. 

Contact the registry office to find out what documents and translations you’ll need.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

*[CNI]:certificate of no impediment
