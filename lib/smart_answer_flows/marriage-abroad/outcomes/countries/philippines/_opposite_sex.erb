## Before you start
Contact the [Civil Registrar](https://psa.gov.ph/lcr-directory) where you want to get married to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

## Prove you’re free to get married
You need to swear an affidavit that says you’re legally allowed to get married. You must do this through a local notary public in the Philippines. 

Contact the [Civil Registrar](https://psa.gov.ph/lcr-directory) to find a local notary public. Check with them what you need to do and what documents you’ll need to bring when you go to swear your affidavit. You can download an [affidavit template](/government/publications/marriage-in-the-philippines) to use.

^Your partner will also need to swear an affidavit if they’re British. If they’re not, they might need an equivalent document.^

## Get married
You should give your affidavit to the [local Civil Registrar](https://psa.gov.ph/lcr-directory) when you apply for a marriage licence.

You’ll usually get the marriage licence 10 days after you apply. You can book your wedding once you’ve got it.

The marriage licence is valid for 120 days and can be used anywhere in the Philippines.

## After you get married
Your marriage will be recognised in the UK if:

- you follow the correct process according to the law in the Philippines
- it would be allowed under UK law

You don’t need to register your marriage in the UK.

If your partner isn’t a British citizen, they can apply for [British citizenship](/becoming-a-british-citizen/if-your-spouse-is-a-british-citizen) once they’ve lived in the UK for 3 years.
