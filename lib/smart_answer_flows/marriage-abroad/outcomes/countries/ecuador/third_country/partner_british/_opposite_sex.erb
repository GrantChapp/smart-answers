You might be able to form a civil partnership. Check the local rules with the [British embassy](/world/organisations/british-embassy-in-ecuador).

^You should [get legal advice](/government/collections/list-of-lawyers) and check the [travel advice for Ecuador](/foreign-travel-advice/ecuador) before making any plans.

##What you need to do
