Contact the local civil registry office where you want to get married in Ecuador before making any plans to find out about local marriage laws, including what documents you’ll need.

You might be able to form a civil partnership. Check the local rules with the [British embassy](/world/organisations/british-embassy-in-ecuador).

##What you need to do

You’ll be asked to provide a certificate of no impediment (CNI) to prove you’re allowed to marry.

To get a CNI, you must post notice of your intended marriage in Ecuador. You can do this at the British embassy or in front of a notary public.

###How to post notice

You’ll need to have been living in Ecuador for at least 3 full days before you can post notice, for example if you arrive in the country on Thursday, the earliest you can post notice is the following Monday.

[Make an appointment at the embassy in Quito](https://www.book-consular-appointment.service.gov.uk/TimeSelection?location=138&service=13).

You’ll need to provide supporting documents, including:

- your passport
- proof of residence, such as a residence certificate - check with the embassy to find out what you need
- equivalent documents for your partner

You’ll need to complete a [‘Notice of marriage’](/government/publications/notice-of-marriage-form--2) form and an [‘Affidavit for marriage’](/government/publications/affirmationaffidavit-of-marital-status-form) form.

You can download and fill in (but not sign) the forms in advance.

You must take the forms with you to your appointment.

%The names on all documents you provide must appear exactly as they do on your passports - if not, the authorities may refuse to allow the marriage to go ahead. You may need to provide evidence if the name on your passport is different to your birth certificate (for example marriage certificate or deed poll).%

^Your partner will need to follow the same process and pay the fees to get their own CNI.^

###If you or your partner have been divorced, widowed or previously in a civil partnership

You’ll also need whichever of the following documents is appropriate:

- a [decree absolute or final order](/copy-decree-absolute-final-order)
- a civil partnership dissolution or annulment certificate
- a [death certificate](/order-copy-birth-death-marriage-certificate/) for your (or your partner’s) former spouse or civil partner

^You’ll also need to provide evidence of nationality or residence if the divorce or dissolution took place outside the UK. You’ll need to get it [legalised](/get-document-legalised) and [translated](/government/collections/lists-of-translators-and-interpreters) if it’s not in English.^

###What happens next

The embassy will charge a fee and display your notice of marriage publicly for 7 days. They’ll then issue the CNI, as long as nobody has registered an objection. There’s an additional fee for this.

You should check with the local civil registry office if your CNI needs to be certified as genuine (legalised) by the local authorities in Ecuador.

^You don't need to stay in the country while your notice is posted.^
