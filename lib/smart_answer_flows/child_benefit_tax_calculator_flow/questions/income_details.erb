  Add up your taxable income. This includes things like:

  - your salary before tax (with pension contributions under net pay arrangements deducted)
  - other employment income, for example bonuses
  - taxable benefits provided by your employer, for example the value of medical insurance, a company car or anything else included on your P11D
  - income from pensions before tax, for example from a state pension
  - other income before tax, for example taxable profits from self-employment, taxable savings and dividends
  - income from property before tax, for example taxable rental income and any taxable benefits provided by your employer such as medical insurance

  You can get some of this information from your P60, P11D, employer or tax adviser.

  This list is not exhaustive. If you are not sure whether a source of income is taxable, [contact the Income Tax Helpline](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees).

  Do not combine your household income. Use your partner’s taxable income if it’s higher than yours.
