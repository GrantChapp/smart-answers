  Examples of allowable deductions include:

  - pension contributions deducted from your pay (do not include contributions deducted before tax)
  - pension contributions not paid from your salary (the amount you actually paid, not the grossed-up amount)
  - gift aid donations

  Do not include deductions from cycle scheme or retirement annuity contracts.

  If you are not sure whether something is an allowable deduction, [contact the Income Tax Helpline](/government/organisations/hm-revenue-customs/contact/income-tax-enquiries-for-individuals-pensioners-and-employees).
