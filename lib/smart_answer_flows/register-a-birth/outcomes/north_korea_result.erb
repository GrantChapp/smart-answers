  ##Documents

  ^Send English translations of all foreign language documents along with the untranslated versions. Use a professional translator and include their name and address with your application. Do not provide laminated documents.^

Depending on the document, you'll be asked to provide an original version or a photocopy. If you provide a photocopy when an original is required, your application will be rejected and the registration fee will not be refunded.

  You must provide the original versions (not photocopies) of:

  - a birth certificate issued by Pyongyang Friendship Hospital
  - the long version of the parent’s birth certificate showing the child’s grandparents’ details (for parents who were born in the UK)
  - the parent’s naturalisation or registration certificate (for parents who were not born in the UK)
  - the parents’ marriage or civil partnership certificate (if applicable)
  - evidence that the parents’ previous marriages or civil partnerships have ended (such as divorce or death certificates)
  - change of name documents (if either parent has ever changed their name)
  - a letter from the parent’s employer if they’re working abroad as a UK civil servant, EU civil servant, diplomat or member of HM Forces (for British parents)
  - written evidence if the parent was born overseas while one of their own parents was working abroad as a UK civil servant, EU civil servant, diplomat or member of HM Forces (for British parents)

  You must also provide photocopies (not original versions) of:

  - the photo page of the child’s British passport if they have one
  - the photo page of the parent’s current passport (for British parents)
  - the birth certificate or the photo page of the parent’s current passport (for parents who are not British)

  %Your application will be rejected if the documents are not authentic, do not confirm the child’s identity or do not prove that the child has a claim to British nationality. The registration fee will not be refunded.%

  ##Cost

  <%= render partial: 'fees',
             locals: { calculator: calculator } %>

  You normally have to pay fees for consular services in the local currency - these are shown in the list of [consular fees](/government/organisations/foreign-commonwealth-office/series/consular-fees).

  You can order copies of the registration certificate from the British embassy when you register the birth.

  Cheaper copies will be available from the [General Register Office](/general-register-office) in the UK, but not until November the year after you register.

  ##Go to the British embassy

  Book an appointment at the British embassy and bring the registration form, supporting documents and the fee.

  <% if calculator.paternity_declaration? %>
    The mother must register the birth. If you want the father’s name on the consular birth certificate, both parents will need to swear a paternity declaration in person at the nearest consulate.

    Paternity declarations are free. Contact the consulate for more details.
  <% else %>
    Either parent can register the birth.

  ^Registration can take up to 3 months - your application will be sent to the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office in London where the birth will be registered.^

  Your documents will be returned to the British Embassy in Pyongyang after the birth has been registered. You’ll also be sent copies of the registration certificate if you’ve paid for them. The embassy will contact you when your documents and certificates are ready for collection.
